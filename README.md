# Project2
###By Ashley Woon

####Project 2 is an Arduino sketch incorporating hardware and software to create an interactive focus breathing tool. 
####Toggling between the four states can be done through using the push button. 
The default state allows the user the change the RGB LED output by twisting the potentiometer. 

After the first button push, the red LED will loop through a timed fade that the user can match their breathing to. This red state has the quickest tempo meant to be used when agitated.

The second button push begins the yellow LED timed loop which brightens to a count of 3, stays steady for a count of 3, and fades for a count of 5.

A third button push starts the slowest cycle for a count of 4-7-8.

Another push returns the LED to its default state with a randomized fade loop.
